2. **üîí SECURITY HARDENING**
   - Implement input sanitization for prompt injection
   - Add command execution restrictions
   - Deploy security monitoring systems
   - Conduct penetration testing

3. **üõ†Ô∏è SYSTEM ROBUSTNESS**
   - Fix missing dependency issues
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Add graceful degradation for corrupted inputs

2. **SECURITY VULNERABILITIES: 2 critical issues**
3. **SYSTEM ROBUSTNESS: 0% fuzz test success**

---

## üîÆ NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Critical Issue Resolution (Est. 2-3 weeks)
1. Implement comprehensive bias mitigation algorithms
2. Deploy security hardening measures
3. Fix system robustness and dependency issues

### Phase 2: Validation & Testing (Est. 1 week)
1. Re-run complete test suite
2. Validate bias score reduction to <1.1
3. Confirm security vulnerability resolution

### Phase 3: Clinical Deployment Preparation (Est. 1 week)
1. Clinical validation with healthcare professionals
2. Performance optimization
3. Production deployment preparation

---

## üìä FINAL VERDICT

**üö® SYSTEM STATUS: NOT READY FOR CLINICAL DEPLOYMENT**

While the DrugBank Clinical RAG system demonstrates excellent clinical reasoning capabilities and perfect schema validation, **critical bias issues and security vulnerabilities** prevent immediate clinical deployment. The detected **4.208 bias score** represents a severe fairness concern that could lead to discriminatory healthcare recommendations.

**Recommendation:** Complete bias mitigation and security hardening before considering clinical deployment.
